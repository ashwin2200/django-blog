# Django Blog
My inital attempt at understanding web frameworks/advanced python, this project gave me a great deal of knowledge from understanding how web frameworks work to creating efficently modified images. This project was my first attempt at an Django Application, written with help [Corey Schafer](https://coreyms.com/) and his [series on Django](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p) which was very helpful in introducing me to Django. I started this project wanting to learn Django and ended up using this project to host a dedicated website for my relatives/family to discuss and write about my late grandfather (RIP).

## Why Django?
Django was really something I was always intrested in learning because I use Python frequently to write small scripts that automate simple tasks (first world problems LOL), and now with Django I'm able to bring that to the web. In addition, I was able to understand and see first hand how large websites like Instagram work/understand their backend, as they utilize the Django framework for their website.

## Skills/Experience
This project covered a lot of areas that will help me later on in my career as a developer, as I could now be classified as a full-stack developer? kind of? idk.
- Working with the Django framework
- Image manipulation with [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
- Authentication via [CSRF Tokens](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/tokens)
- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- Building a front-end with CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap, UIKit)
- Understanding structure of backend websites
